# quintessence
A project for testing and getting familiar with JavaScript, Windows PowerShell, Python, Flask, and Firebase API
"app.zip" file contains all the files I have worked on so far

# instructions
1. Install Flask (Python's microframework) (check out this link for an easy to install Flask https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPMr0lEMqpo)
2. Install Python 3 (3.6.5 recommended)
3. Download the files from this repository
4. Open Windows PowerShell
5. Use command "pip install firebase-admin" for firebase api use
6. Navigate and change directory to where the file "server.py" is
7. Type in command "py server.py" to run the program
8. Once the program runs, open a browser and enter "localhost:8000"
9. The link will lead the user to the main page to interact with other webpages using a local server

# to-do things
 Expand the applications of this project such as including music, photo gallery, etc.
 Photo gallery needs tranferred to firebase for realtime database purposes
