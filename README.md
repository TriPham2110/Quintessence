2. Install Python 3 (3.6.5 recommended)
3. Download the files from this repository
4. Open Windows PowerShell
5. Use command "pip install firebase-admin" for firebase api use
6. Navigate and change directory to where the file "server.py" is
7. Type in command "py server.py" to run the program
8. Once the program runs, open a browser and enter "localhost:8000"
9. The link will lead the user to the main page to interact with other webpages using a local server
